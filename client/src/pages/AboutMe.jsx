        <p className="text-lg mb-4">My name is Aidan and i'm a student enrolled in the University of Utah full-stack coding bootcamp. This website contains a section about myself and my history, a section containing some of the projects ive worked on and have been a part of, and a finally a section containing contact information. Click the links in the navigation bar above to switch to a different page.</p>
        
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">Throughout this course ive had the opportunity to work with and learn many components within 'web development', stuff like Javascript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I think that all of the different components of web development are interesting and useful in their own ways, but I do have my favorites. I prefer working with front end and UI, utilizing React and Vite as well as third-party stylesheets such as Bootstrap or Tailwindcss. I would love to improve my skills on the front-end, and i'm sure I will, but I also realize the importance of the back-end too. I've worked extensively with SQL, Sequelize, Express, and small packages such as dotenv or jest. The back-end is where I believe I have the most room to improve, and that's where I intend to focus my efforts after the completion of this course.</p>
        
        <p className="text-lg mb-4">As previously mentioned I am still enrolled in the coding bootcamp, so currently my focus is on graduating the bootcamp. After I graduate though, I plan on looking for internships or entry-level jobs in the field. I plan on traveling often so I intend to find some virtual or semi-virtual options for work. </p>
